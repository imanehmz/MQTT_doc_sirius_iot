          <h3>Why MQTT</h3>
          <p>
            MQTT is a low network lightweight protocol based on TCP/IP, it is
            low on energy and advantageous especially for wireless devices it
            reduces the network bandwidth in communication and minimizes data
            packets
          </p>

        <!-- intro -->
        <h2 id="Description">Description</h2>
        <p>
          For our summer internship project, we worked on different IoT
          solutions at Sirius NET. We have got to learn a lot and to practice
          our programming skills that we acquired at school or at clubs. This
          internship opened our eyes to the IoT field, with our supervisor Mr
          Amine Fellahi that has been a generous encyclopedia that didn’t
          hesitate to share with us his years of experience in the field. Our
          solution is based on a BCE GPS device, it is a device that offers many
          functionalities such as GPS, weather data and can also be linked to
          other sensors such as the car’s CAN. We worked on getting the data
          from the BCE device to the server and database using the MQTT
          protocol,and translating the payloads from their formats to human
          readable information.
        </p>
        <!-- IOT -->
        <h2 id="IOT">IOT</h2>
        <p>
          The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical
          objects—“things”—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other
          technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with
          other devices and systems over the internet. These devices range from
          ordinary household objects to sophisticated industrial tools
        </p>

        <!-- grid system -->
        <h2 id="MQTT">MQTT</h2>
        <p>
          In this internship we've used an MQTT broker to guarantee the
          communication between our device and the server. In this part, we'll
          be talking about MQTT and how you can use it for your IOT solution.
          MQTT is a communication protocol based on tcp/ip.The first version of
          the protocol was authored in 1999[<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT#cite_note-5"
          >
            1</a
          >] by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Stanford-Clark">
            Andy Stanford-Clark</a
          >from IBM. It was used to monitor oil pipelines within the SCADA
          industrial control system.[<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT#cite_note-6"
            >2</a
          >] The goal was to have a protocol that is bandwidth-efficient,
          lightweight and uses little battery power, because the devices were
          connected via satellite link which, at that time, was extremely
          expensive.
        </p>

        <!-- How does it work -->
        <h3>How does MQTT work</h3>
        <p>In MQTT, we have a broker, subscriber and publisher.</p>
        <div class="imgClass">
          <img
            src="./mqtt_broker.png"
            alt="mqtt broker"
            style="padding-top: 7px"
          />
          <p style="padding-top: 7px">
            <a
              >Example of an MQTT connection (QoS 0) with connect,
              publish/subscribe, and disconnect. The first message from client B
              is stored due to the retain flag.
            </a>
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4>BROKER</h4>
        <p>
          A broker is a piece of software running on a computer (running
          on-premises or in the cloud), and could be self-built or hosted by a
          third party. It is available in both open source and proprietary
          implementations. The broker acts as a post office. MQTT clients don't
          use a direct connection address of the intended recipient, but use the
          subject line called "Topic". Anyone who subscribes receives a copy of
          all messages for that topic. Multiple clients can subscribe to a topic
          from a single broker (one to many capability), and a single client can
          register subscriptions to topics with multiple brokers (many to one).
          [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT">3</a>]
        </p>
        <h4>SUBSCRIBER</h4>
        <p>
          A subscriber is an entity that subscribes to a specific topic on a
          broker.it can subscribe to many topics at the same time, a subscriber
          will receive all the messages sent in that topic.
        </p>
        <h4>PUBLISHER</h4>
        <p>
          A publisher is an entity that publishes,sends messages on a specific
          topic. The subscriber of that topic will receive it. In our case the
          publisher is the device because it's the one sending messages. When it
          comes to choosing a broker, we have many open source options.In order
          to get familiar with MQTT, it is recommended to start with HIVEMQ
          which will be explained in a later section. For our project, we used a
          Mosquitto broker that we installed on the server, Mosquitto will be
          detailed in a later section.
        </p>
        <h3>Quality of service</h3>
        <p>
          Each connection to the broker can specify a quality of service (QoS)
          measure. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT#cite_note-24"
            >4</a
          >] These are classified in increasing order of overhead:
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● At most
          once  the message is sent only once and the client and broker take no
          additional steps to acknowledge delivery (fire and forget). <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● At least
          once  the message is re-tried by the sender multiple times until
          acknowledgement is received (acknowledged delivery).<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ● Exactly
          once the sender and receiver engage in a two-level handshake to
          ensure only one copy of the message is received (assured delivery).<br />
          This field does not affect handling of the underlying TCP data
          transmissions; it is only used between MQTT senders and receivers
        </p>
        <!-- HIVEMQ -->
        <h2 id="HIVEMQ">HiveMQ</h2>
        <h3>What is HiveMQ</h3>
        <p>
          HiveMQ is an online MQTT broker, in which you can simplify your Iot
          application to only developing the client side, it offers several
          tools for device management, including a dashboard with real-time data
          displays. Role-based access can be configured and extensions are
          monitored. You can benefit from HiveMQ free features by following this
          documentation, and you can also use the business plan for larger
          projects.
        </p>
        <h3>Getting started with HiveMQ</h3>
        <p>
          First, go to HiveMQ cloud under Cloud in the navigation bar, and then
          create an account on Sign up now, you can choose to log in using your
          email or github. After that you will get you profile as follows:
          Choose the plan that suits you
        </p>
        <div class="imgClass2">
          <img src="./images/hivemq/image5.png" alt="h1" width="700" height="400"/>
          <img src="./images/hivemq/image3.png" alt="h2" width="700" height="400"/>
          <p>Select the HiveMQ package that you want.</p>

          <img src="./images/hivemq/image7.png" alt="h3" width="700" height="400"/>
        </div>
        <p>
          Choose a service provider,once you are in, it&lsquo;s time to create a
          cluster! Next, go to Manage Cluster and then choose Access management
          on the top so that you can provide a user name and a password for your
          cluster, it looks like this :
        </p>
        <div class="imgClass2">
          <img src="./images/hivemq/image16.png" alt="h3" width="700" height="400"/>

        </div>
        <p>
          After that, go to Getting started, you will see multiple tools to use
          for your IoT applications
        </p>
        <div class="imgClass2">
          <img src="./images/hivemq/image45.png" alt="h4" width="700" height="400"/>
        </div>

        <h3>Websockets Client:</h3>
        <p>
          You can publish and subscribe using the user interface of HiveMQ, and
          that&lsquo;s through the Websocket Client, here is an example of a
          simple publish/subscribe scenario. The websockets client is right
          here. <br />
          Click on Access the websockets client and then, on the box that
          appears, click on connect. Now you are connected as a client to your
          cluster. <br />
          Now let&lsquo;s publish a message ! <br />
          go to the publish section and write your message, specify the topic
          and the quality of the service
        </p>

        <div class="imgClass2">
          <img src="./images/hivemq/image11.png" alt="h5" width="700" height="400" />
        </div>
<p>
  Write a message and pick the topic,click on publish, your message is published now, but
where to find it ? <br>
Well, since you didn&lsquo;t do any subscription, no one will receive it !
Let&lsquo;s now do a subscribe to a topic. <br>
Go to the Subscriptions section and click on Add a new topic subscription, add the topic
and the Qos. Republish your message now.
</p>
<div class="imgClass2">
  <img src="./images/hivemq/image20.jpg" alt="h6" />
  <p> Your message is successfully published now!</p>
</div>

<p>
  Note: the &lsquo;#&lsquo;means: All topics, if you use the following specification, for example :
  Anytopic/#, this means that all topics under &lsquo;AnyTopic&lsquo; are included in the subscription.
